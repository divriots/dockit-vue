# dockit-vue

This documentation kit contains a few key pieces that will help you write cool documentation for your Vue based design system.

## Layout

A [layout implementation](../../layout/doc/index.md) is provided, which you can use easily in your own design system.
This is easy and documented in the [Backlight documentation](https://backlight.dev/docs/md-vue).

## Documentation components

A few documentation components are provided:

- [Playground](../../playground/doc/playground.md) - to provide live examples of Vue component usages
- [Description](../../description/doc/description.md) - to simply render the description of a component that was written as code comment
- [Props](../../props/doc/props.md) - to simply render the documentation of the props of a component that was written as code comments
